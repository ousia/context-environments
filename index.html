<a id="context-environments" class="anchor" href="#context-environments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ConTeXt Environments</h1>

<p>This project aims to create environments that allow ConTeXt to directly typeset XML files.</p>

<p>This website and its matching repository only contain a list of created or planned environments.</p>

<p>Initally, it contained the environment files, but I realized that each environment should have its own repository.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pandoc" class="anchor" href="#pandoc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>pandoc</h2>

<p>Right now, only the <code>pandoc-xhtml.tex</code> environment is available. My aim is to have a method to typeset high–quality PDF documents with ConTeXt from HTML files generated by pandoc.</p>

<p>It is still <em>work in progress</em>. The main issue that I’m experiencing is the following: the manual—<a href="http://pragma-ade.com/show-man-44.htm">Dealing with XML in ConTeXt MkIV</a>—is all Greek to me.</p>

<p>I have some experience with XML and ConTeXt MkIV. Only as an average user, not as a programer (I cannot code myself). The way ConTeXt deals with XML is totally new to me. I have to learn first how it works.</p>

<p>The project has now its own site: <a href="http://www.from-pandoc-to-context.tk">http://www.from-pandoc-to-context.tk</a>. Its repository is located at <a href="https://github.com/ousia/from-pandoc-to-context/">https://github.com/ousia/from-pandoc-to-context/</a>. Both code and issues belong to that project.</p>

<h2>
<a id="other-environments" class="anchor" href="#other-environments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other environments</h2>

<p>I’m also interested in creating an environment for TEΙ (at least to typeset <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/">their Guidelines</a>).</p>



<h2>
<a id="acknowledgments" class="anchor" href="#acknowledgments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>I couldn’t have thought of compiling XML sources with ConTeXt without the help of Hans Hagen. First and foremost, because of the development of this extraordinary piece of software called ConTeXt. And second, because he patiently replied all my questions about handling XML in ConTeXt.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Schuster has also helped me the vast majority of times I posted a question about ConTeXt in its mainling list. His answers are always instructive and straight to the needed point. Without his help, I wonder whether I would be still using ConTeXt.</p>

<p>Many thanks, Hans and Wolfgang, for your time, your patience, your work and your help.</p>
