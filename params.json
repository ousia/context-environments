{"name":"ConTeXt Environments","tagline":"environments for ConTeXt to handle XML documents","body":"# ConTeXt Environments\r\n\r\nThis project aims to create environments that allow ConTeXt to directly typeset XML files.\r\n\r\nThis website and its matching repository only contain a list of created or planned environments.\r\n\r\nInitally, it contained the environment files, but I realized that each environment should have its own repository.\r\n\r\n## pandoc\r\n\r\nRight now, only the `pandoc-xhtml.tex` environment is available. My aim is to have a method to typeset high–quality PDF documents with ConTeXt from HTML files generated by pandoc.\r\n\r\nIt is still *work in progress*. The main issue that I’m experiencing is the following: the manual—[Dealing with XML in ConTeXt MkIV](http://pragma-ade.com/show-man-44.htm)—is all Greek to me.\r\n\r\nI have some experience with XML and ConTeXt MkIV. Only as an average user, not as a programer (I cannot code myself). The way ConTeXt deals with XML is totally new to me. I have to learn first how it works.\r\n\r\nThe project has now its own site: <http://www.from-pandoc-to-context.tk>. Its repository is located at <https://github.com/ousia/from-pandoc-to-context/>. Both code and issues belong to that project.\r\n\r\n## Other environments\r\n\r\nI’m also interested in creating an environment for TEΙ (at least to typeset [their Guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/)).\r\n\r\n<!-- safari book and W3C documents -->\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nI couldn’t have thought of compiling XML sources with ConTeXt without the help of Hans Hagen. First and foremost, because of the development of this extraordinary piece of software called ConTeXt. And second, because he patiently replied all my questions about handling XML in ConTeXt.\r\n\r\nWolfgang Schuster has also helped me the vast majority of times I posted a question about ConTeXt in its mainling list. His answers are always instructive and straight to the needed point. Without his help, I wonder whether I would be still using ConTeXt.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, Hans and Wolfgang, for your time, your patience, your work and your help.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed to the public under the GNU General Public License; either [version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), or (at your option) any [later version](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
